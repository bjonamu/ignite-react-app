### Containers Folder
A container is what they call a "Smart Component" in Redux.  It is a component
which knows about Redux.

The purpose of this file is to setup Redux or any other non-visual "global" modules.

\`RootContainer.js\` is the first visual component in the app.  It is the ancestor of all other screens and components and starts the navigation within the app

You'll probably find you'll have great mileage in Ignite apps without even touching the RootContainer. It, of course, belong to you, so when you're ready to add something non-visual like Firebase or something visual like an overlay, you have spots to place these additions.
